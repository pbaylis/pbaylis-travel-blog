We woke up early to be the first customers at a delicious french place for breakfast. It’s called La Boulangerie and is in Lapa, Sam and Emma’s former neighborhood.

They had some stuff to pick up from a nearby colleague of Sam’s, so I took off for Melem, a town just outside of Lisbon with some famous sights. I saw -- but did not actually enter -- most of them just by walking around, but was deterred by crowds and lines. The Padrão dos Descobrimentos is a remarkable edifice which leans out over water and celebrates the Portuguese age of discovery, it was constructed relatively recently.

The Tower of Belem is farther down the water at the mouth of the Tagus river, built to defend against pirates. And the Jerónimos Monastery is a large, old building which now houses a planetarium and the maritime museum inside. Instead, I picked up a few pastries at Pasties de Belem (withstanding a long but quick-moving line) and headed for the botanical garden. The botanical garden was gorgeous, relatively peaceful and full of peacocks!

After an hour or two of wandering, I headed back to Lisbon proper to meet up with Emma and to walk to the Parc de Estrala, only about one km from our place. It was warm, so we worked in the shade at a cafe table and later at a stone table hidden behind some trees. We came back to the house later after grocery shopping + gelato, watched a bit of TV, worked for a bit, and called it a night. Sam had a deadline at work and didn’t get home until much later. Which is a good sign, I think, for my purposes, since I wanted them to be able to get into their usual life routine without too much interruption from my end.
