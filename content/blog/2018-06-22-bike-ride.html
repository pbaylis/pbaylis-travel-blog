<p>Slept in today, despite the light blazing in around 6am. Struggled through a workday – I’m finding that my lofty expectations of my own productivity are mostly going unfulfilled, and thinking about why that is. Am I too distracted? Or missing some compelling push to motivate? It’s hard to say. At any rate, I ended up setting relatively modest productivity goals and (mostly) achieving them, though frustratingly most of the actual work time was spent recreating code that I’d essentially already built.</p>
<p>A friend e-mailed me back about his own productivity thoughts and challenges, and recommended “Deep Work” by Cal Newport, which argues that real value is created by uninterrupted chunks of time spent deep in thought and that devices, e-mails, websites, etc. are all anathematic to that goal. I’m inclined to agree.</p>
<p>But how to implement? It would be good to treat this as a reboot for work habits. A start: outline bad habits that I have and good habits I’d like to cultivate:</p>
<p>Bad habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking NYTimes, Twitter, /r/ultimate, WireCutter, MacRumors, ESPN, Facebook, and other time-wasting sites constantly throughout the day</li>
<li>Keeping my e-mail open all of the time</li>
<li>Stressing and becoming frustrated about productivity</li>
</ul>
<p>Good habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 minutes of writing at the beginning of each day</li>
<li>Goal setting (monthly, weekly, daily)</li>
<li>Each task should have an output</li>
<li>Don’t Repeat Yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>There, that’s a start. Now to the rest of the day. It ended very enjoyably, with a long (2 hour) bike ride around the island while listening to <a href="https://magazine.atavist.com/american-hippopotamus">American Hippopotamus</a>, by Jon Mooallem. It was mostly a character sketch of a few remarkable men around the turn of the century, though hippos did feature. Along the ride I ran across a brewery where Michael, the brewer, gave me some free samples, and a music festival. I got home and talked with Erin on the phone while I made dinner, which was delightful. I do wish she was here.</p>
