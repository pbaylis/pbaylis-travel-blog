Madrid! Woke up early, arrived in Madrid around 9. The hotel I got in Bajaras was actually walkable from the airport, although it didn’t seem encouraged. They were kind enough to let me check in early, so after a brief workout and a shower I headed into town.

I started in El Retiro Park, which is huge and filled with enormous statues (much like, well, Madrid, it would turn out). It also has a tremendous pool filled with rowboats and overlooked by huge statues per usual. Then I headed west, walking past impressive government buildings and statues until I got to the Puerta Del Sol, which seemed to be a bit of an iconic and touristic heart of Madrid. Madrid feels different from Lisbon in many ways, of course, but it struck me that the sheer quantity and size of many of the statues and monuments spoke to a longer and somewhat wealthier recent past.

The crowds built up as I headed through the Plaza Mayor, where I picked up a ham and cheese sandwich at the outdoor market (a mistake - every time I’ve had one of these sandwiches this trip I’ve regretted it) . To escape, I turned north.
Ended up at a coffee shop called HanSo Cafe in Malasana, which was packed - packed! - with students studying abroad. But it was too hot to walk around, so I worked for a few hours before getting restless. I walked a bit west to the Sabatini gardens, which a set a bit below the main streets at the foot of more fabulous government buildings. For some reason the gardens just smell… good, and they’re also laid out beautifully. But my favorite part was the gentleman “playing” violin to a recording. He had a violin, and a bow that he moved across the strings…! But his fingering hand never moved. Good on him. 


After grabbing a quick bite at a place nearby, I ended the night at a Flamenco show at Las Carboneras. It was incredible. I didn’t know what to expect, but this version of Flamenco was a combination of incredibly high energy tap dancing, and mostly a cappella singing with Spanish-style guitar. Each of the 4 dancers (3 female, 1 male) took turns soloing during a given piece, about 15 minutes of intense movement. The crowd was definitely (entirely) non-locals but still reasonably reverent.

A side note: my dinner table companion was a middle-aged British woman named Marie who was really into astrology and Tao and more than willing to talk about herself at length. She talked a lot about her latest reading and having worked with Mother Theresa. And wanting to go to Somalia. She also said some weirder things like “it’s really a privilege to be with people as they die” and “I really enjoyed the people with leprosy”. The people you meet…

I left the show and just walked around Madrid for a couple hours. It really is a late night city - at 11pm, many were just sitting down to dinner, and the clubs hadn’t even opened yet. Not that clubs were in my future. I did find a churro shop, which gave me a gift of more churros than I wanted (but which was kind). Warm churros are the best. Cold churros, even cream-filled or covered in chocolate, are just okay. I finally got to get past midnight for another early wakeup call to head back to the states.

One more observation about Spain, or my experience in Madrid at least: people are much more likely to let you muddle through in Spanish than in Lisbon. Not sure if that’s representative of different abilities or just a different attitude towards visitors, but I kind of like it - especially because I can get by a bit more in Spanish than in Portuguese.
