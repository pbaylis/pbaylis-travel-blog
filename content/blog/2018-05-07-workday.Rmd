This was a work day, so little travel to report. Emma is joining me in trying the “write for 30 mins to start the day” strategy, since she’s in the process of trying to crank out three papers. At lunch, I took off for a nice break at a local park where I sat near the turtles, at the local standard (bread, ham, and cheese), read my book, and people-watched. Sam and I met up in the evening to run at the only local track we know of.
