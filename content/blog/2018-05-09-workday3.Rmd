title: "Work day with recreational park"

Mostly a work day… productive in the morning but hit a wall. Did go for a quick solo run before dinner, which brought me back up into the same hills as the last one but this time I found a “recreational park” which was quite appealing and… mostly empty? My theory is that parking is so bad in the city that nobody wants to give up their parking spot to drive up here. Dinner was Tapas with some very friendly waiters down in Lapa. Food was pretty good - esp. the octopus. Should not have had an espresso before bed - restless all night. Josh Neff (Emma’s friend from UCSF who I knew in the bay as well) just arrived for a few days, he’s now sharing top bunk of my bunk bed.
