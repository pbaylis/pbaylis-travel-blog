## A “rocky” start
Having been tempted by glimpses of azure waters on our brief bus ride to Thiers (just North of old town), we quickly deposited our bags at our lovely Airbnb and prioritized the one thing that stood between us and the beach — growling stomachs. Upon recommendation from our Airbnb host George, we took a quick two block walk to a corner bistro where we had our first authentic Nicoise meal (pizza for Pat and Niçoise salad for Erin). Cool water on the brain, we swapped our airplane outfits for our maillot de bains and headed to the beach.

As a Californian, I was shocked when my feet hit not sand, but rocks as we came within a foot of the waves. Complaining about rocky beaches feels… wrong, but it was admittedly a more painful experience than expected. The water, on the other hand, was cool, clear, and an undeniably perfect temperature.

## Stepping down into old town

Just as we wondered, “Mais, ou est tous les enfants?!” we stumbled upon the gorgeous public park that separates old town from “new,” and found… tous les enfants — playing soccer, performing interpretive dance, and triumphantly chasing pigeons.
You cannot miss old town because you literally descend down stairs to enter the maze of old brick streets. For dinner, we dined in a hip French “hole-in-the wall” bistro spotted by Pat. 9 for ambiance, 8 for service, 6 for food, and 2 for quality of fish de-boning. Overall, wonderful experience with the highlight being the grapefruit spritz ordered by Pat (and hijacked by Erin).

## Always Nice-r with AC

Our full day of Nice exploration began with a split morning workout (Pat with a run and Erin with a barre class video), followed by a mission to the Marché aux Fleurs — Nice’s longstanding flower market that now offers much more than flowers. We checked off our to-do list item to sample Socca — a chickpea flour “crepe” of sorts that is baked on a large castiron circle and cut into slices before being packed in a paper cone for easy carrying. I found myself wishing for some ketchup, Pat craved yogurt as a condiment. Overall, tasty, but a bit dry after stuffing several slices into your mouth in rapid succession — oops.

Climbing to the top of Nice’s castle lookout, we were shocked to find a public park with playgrounds and ice cream in addition to the royal ruins.

A brief fuel-up was required, and we happily ate Niçoise salad (round deux) and a burratta, pesto tartine to supplement our Socca snack. Dying to escape the heat, we decided to make our way to Musee Matisse. Confident that we would be able to leverage public transportation to make our way out of downtown, we were saddened by the never-appearing bus #17. Uber to the rescue.
At Musee Matisse we learned of the Picasso celebration going on across France from 2017-2019. Museums, venues, and shows across the country were teaming together to feature his story and work. As a result, we enjoyed learning about Picasso and Matisse’s interwining lives, and fairly similar ventures into Fauvism. Artistic evidence was provided to show how both men challenged “the model,” with greater abstraction from their previous (more realistic) depictions of odalisques. I loved seeing how Matisse’s art became larger - in boldness and physical size - as he aged and ailed. La piscine - a life-size banner depicting swimmers diving in and out of water was Matisse’s way of enjoying the water and satisfying his love for swimming long after he was able to physically go to the pool. I was sufficiently inspired to take a crack at my own “cutout art” upon returning to Seattle — which sparked a whole separate investigation into international copyright law for art of deceased artists like Matisse.

That night, though tired, we managed to make our way back into old town for a bit of food and jazz. After some decent Mediterranean fare, Shapko offered us a jazz quartet and melange of French viewers — old and young — to enjoy the music along with.

## Mais oui, of course we Cannes!

Day trip 1: Cannes! Le TGV (the French speed train) was our chauffeur as we made the quick journey to the sand-filled beaches town just a couple of stops away. For me, this morning would mark a momentous occassion — ‘twas on this morn that I first enjoyed a feuillette aux abricots, my new favorite pastry. Imagine an insanely flakey croissant — flattened, with flame-roasted, sweet-tart apricots laid atop (DROOL. I must try to replicate this in the states).

![Drooling in Cannes](/img/dolonice/image3.jpg)

After defending our pastries from multiple pigeon attacks, we explored town. Hilly, we traversed up and down the back streets of Cannes — instinctively avoiding the more glamorous shops and film festival crowd. We discovered a delicious-looking restaurant - Tredici - that was sadly closed the day we were in town. Onto the “to-do” list it goes for our return trip!

![A quieter backstreet in Cannes](/img/dolonice/image25.jpg)

The beach - public and free - was a true upgrade from our rockier experience in Nice. We remarked how crazy it is that geologically you can have natural sand and natural rock beaches so close to each other.
For the late afternoon, we boarded a ferry that took us to the island of Sainte Marguerite. Home to campgrounds as well as an old town turned kid-summer-camp, we enjoyed yet another different perspective on Cannes.

Returning home, we cooked our own quinoa, salmon, goat cheese nectarine salad dinner and enjoyed a quieter night to ourselves.

## Day trip 2: The Medieval mindset

Originally hoping to see and hike among waterfalls at Sud du Loup, we rented a car for the day and drove inland, up into the hills. Our day progressed from one medieval town to the next, starting with the most quaint — Gourdon — and ending with the largest and perhaps most modern — Vence. The medieval mindset from the eyes of a modern day traveler: impossibly cute, impossibly perched. These deteriorating, yet vibrant old villages looked as though they might just fall right off the ledge of the mountain they were built upon, erosion threatening their existence. Safe for now, each one offered a stunning view of Nice and environs as well as sufficient brick-road mazes to get lost in.

Exploring the backside of one of these towns, we found a hiking path — perhaps once used as a main thoroughfare for traveling between mountain villages — that led us down the hill toward what can best be described as hardened lava fields. The ashy rock was mysterious and abundant.

## Gorge-ous day en route to St. Remy

Every time I stand up paddleboard, I remember how much slower it is than kayaking. Yet I somehow always allow the perfect amount of time pass in between outings such that I forget any frustration associated with the sport. My France experience proved no different, but was gorgeous, and peaceful all the same.
Morning showers gave way to afternoon sunshine and a brisk wind as we arrived at Gorges du Verdon. We struck out onto the river with paddles in hand and quickly discovered that an afternoon workout was in store. The green-blue water and stunning limestone gorge kept our eyes satiated over the course of three hours of paddleboarding. Pat can even proudly claim successful “cliff jumper” status after scrambling up the rocky gorge wall and diving in. Little did he know he would also discover just how swift the gorge’s current was as he tried to catch up to me and the paddleboards that were effortlessly sprinting downriver.
Time flew and before we knew it we were running late for a serendipitous meetup with two of my business school classmates who were traveling through Aix. Together, we dined at a unique, delightful restaurant that truly lived up to its name - drole de l’endroit - funny little place. The menu — presented on a 3 foot high blackboard, rolled from one table to the next — was varied and delicious. The highlight was the salmon gravalax — a Norwegian specialty where the salmon is “cooked” (cured?) using salt, but no heat. Too full and sleepy for dessert, we made the rest of our drive to our Saint Remy airbnb and we’re asleep in a flash.

## A Water-ful recipe for Provence charm
Off we set to Saint Remy for a view of the town in the daylight. Small, and enclosed in a circular road, it didn’t take us long to explore the city in it’s entirety. Don’t get us wrong, it was adorable (minus the terrible circus music emitted from carousel loudspeakers at 9am) but something was missing.
L’isle sur la sorgue was our next stop. Known for antiqueing, the town also had a market that day which provided motivation for the 30 minute drive. Arrival to the city was like a deep sigh — this was somehow better. Why? Water always seems to win. With the Sorgue river — surprisingly, partially man made — running through the middle of town and waterwheels dotting the main walking path, we felt refreshed (despite remaining dry). Our only regret was not arriving earlier so as to purchase more goods at the local market, which included not just fruits, cheese, and saucisson, but olive wood cutting boards, scarves, and lavender sachets. After collecting ample supplies for a picnic, we made our way to a more remote part of the river to enjoy the “natural” beauty further.

The day only continued to improve, with a trip down to Ville des Baux. Here, we took in an artful audio visual show of Picasso and the Spanish greats, whose works were projected onto huge walls of a dark, enclosed limestone quarry. Experiential art, it was. We were able to freely walk around the huge quarry, enjoying new views from different heights and positions. There had to have been 40+ projectors in use inside the space, resulting in an incredibly varied visual landscape with very little image repetition. Hunks of limestone carved out of the quarry many years ago were used to build the nearby medieval village. From the show venue we also learned why the city was known as the city of “baux,” which, in this case stands for bauxite — a mineral found in the region.

Our espresso must have been extra-caffeinated that day. Despite all that had already been accomplished, we took a quick dip in our resort-like airbnb pool, showered off, and make the 30 minute walk back into Saint Remy to give the town another try - this time at night.

![Pool time](/img/dolonice/image14.jpg)

After comparing menus at about six different sidewalk bistros, we settled on a spot with a decently priced “formule.” For appetizers, fried zucchini flowers with a yogurt dipping sauce and some sort of eggplant tomato soufflé. The souffle won round one. For entrees, we got a tuna steak and durade sauté — both excellent. The wine, however, may have been the star of the night. It met all of my requirements for being “barn-yard-y” on the nose, dark and complex on the palate, and as smooth as could be. A lovely, yet semi-dangerous stroll home along the busy street led to brief stargazing by the pool. This may have been our most action-packed day yet!
Arles you with me?
Daytrip #2 from our Saint Remy launching pad led us to the medieval town of Arles, renowned for it’s Roman ruins. Reminiscent of the colosseum, yet much smaller in scale, the village is home to an arena that still hosts bull fights and other performances today. City officials were setting up for a live music performance later that evening in the Roman amphitheater, but because payment was required for entry to all of these sites, the city felt more touristy and less inviting than we had hoped. Further, the great size of the Rhône made the city’s water feature feel more industrial than charming.

Our greatest find was a hippie outdoor environmental festival taking place in a courtyard under trees. We took shelter from the heat of the sun, ate very reasonably priced veggie plates (julienned zucchini and beets, lentil salad, fresh lettuce, and a slice of foccocia-like tomato bread) and enjoyed live music along with toddlers, grandfathers, and other tourists.
Post-lunch we set out for Le Maison Huile (?????) — an olive farm and cave where we were treated to an in-depth, excellent tour (in French!) on how they produce their oil on site. We were able to see all of the machinery used in the process — mostly tubes — that contained the relevant blades to grind and then “Malaxe” (a churning process that prevents emusification) the olives. I always knew that you should look for “first cold-press” on extra virgin olive oil bottles as a mark of quality, but it wasn’t until this tour that I learned why. At warmer temperatures, the olive oil maker is able to extract greater quantities of oil, but at the expense of the oil’s quality. A centrifuge is used twice, first to separate the olive skin and meat from the oil and water mixture, and again to separate the olive oil from the vegetable water. The farm was committed to reducing waste, and actually uses the dried olive meats as fuel (for burning!) and fertilizer. Our guide was clear that the olive meat skin byproduct from the oil making process is not the same olives used for tapenade. Tapenade olives are cured in a completely separate process.
But that wasn’t even “ol-ive” the fun! We haven’t even gotten to the tasting. We sampled six different oils — 3 “dolce” (or soft) and 3 that were more bold. It was amazing how different each one tasted. The softest tasted like butter — no bite at all. Then they became increasingly spicy but with different accent flavors, such as artichoke. Our favorite was “Pitchouline” which we bought a large canister of for what is likely to be rapid consumption back in the states. We concluded our tour with even more samples of their homemade fruit vinegars, mustards, tapenades, and confitures (jams).
That evening, we ventured to the town of Eygalier, which Pat termed “the Martha’s vineyard of Provence.”


Indeed, we quickly noticed the stylish, white-shirt wearing French dining out on the quaint roads. This town felt much more posh and wealthy than others we had explored. We were surprised to find long communal picnic tables lined up in the main square, and learned that it was town’s beginning of Bastille Day celebrations (apparently they let the fun start the eve before). Oddly, paella was the communal dinner being served that night. What happened to French cuisine on their day of national freedom? Music and dancing ensued — likely til late in the evening — but we made our way home early to crawl into bed.
Sur le pont, d’Avignon…
...one now pays to take selfies rather than dance.

Our Avignon exploration was timely — it was during the middle of the city’s most important arts festival of the year. As we learned from one friendly Frenchman while waiting in line for buckwheat crepe, “this festival is the only time of year when French people talk to each other. And it’s to ask what shows and performances are the best.” Flyer after flyer after street performance teaser vied for our attendance. Unfortunately, due to our required 7pm check-in deadline at our Aix-en-Provence airbnb, we weren’t able to stay for any shows, but our whole city walk was like one big show in itself! Beat boxers, dancers, and drummers all kept us entertained. We learned that “le pont” used to have 20 arches, not just the four that remain following a detrimental flood. Lucky for us, the lack of bridge connecting one side of the river to the other has been supplemented with a free ferry, which we happily enjoyed.

Avignon, buzzing with all the art and culture, also felt younger than many other Provence towns we had visited thus far. We took lunch as a trendy spot called Milk Shop — apparently popular with many of the students in Avignon — and were even able to find the elusive iced latte later in the afternoon, a sure sign of American influence.


In the absence of formal show attendance, we did explore the funky, intriguing interior of an old mansion-turned-art-gallery. Though the collection had lent some of it’s Picasso and Cezanne pieces to other shows in the region, there was still an abundance of art to enjoy, including a striking drawing of “Les Danseues” on green paper. My favorite part of the gallery was the top floor, which contained modern, math-inspired art. Perhaps my favorite piece was a “paint-by-numbers” like composition using Pi to dictate which color line came next in a brigade of colorful stripes.

After a quick drive to Aix, a meet and greet with our airbnb host and a few minutes of relaxation, we rushed off to a highly reviewed restaurant at the bottom of old town that was able to squeeze us in for a reservation at the last minute. One delightful, charming waitress was working the entire restaurant — le Gambetta — and we were thoroughly impressed by her ability to manage everything. We enjoyed steak tartare, salmon, lots of bread, and more good wine.
More Aix-ploration
The next day we aimed to take in Aix in the daylight - something we hadn’t yet been able to do. A brief morning run to explore some of Cezanne’s painting lookouts and old city ruins was followed by rapid consumption of les pains at chocolat and brunch. By noon, the French were already out on the streets in their blue, white, and red, ready to cheer their beloved team on in the World Cup final. Three hours before the game began, chanting and singing was already echoing off the city walls.
Determined to take in a little more history before the game commenced, we paid for entry into Cezanne’s atelier. Haven been born and having died in Aix, we learned that Cezanne really was — and still is — Aix’s “golden boy.” The atelier was just one room, but rich in objects of interest. Huge windows ensured ample light, and on one corner of the room, you could see the curious notch that had been cut out of the exterior wall to allow Cezanne to get his massive canvases outside — so as to see all the brilliant colors he was painting with in full sunlight (see photo below). From old letters he had written to Monet to easels and painting coats, it was really special to peer into his life years ago.


It goes without saying that we capped off our day by watching France dominate in the World Cup! This marks the second time France has won and the second time Pat has been in France when they’ve won! 2 for 2!
An Aix-cellent Finish
Our final daytrip led us out to the coastal city of Cassis — a more “lowkey” version of Cannes with the added bonus of calanques. What we initially thought might be an easy stroll turned into a three hour hike along the coast, providing awesome views of the turquoise blue waters and soaring cliffs that make up the calanques - or inlets - that the region is known for. Midway through the hike, rolling thunder and lightning strikes began threatening us. We were shocked to see people still headed out to the water/into the national park as heavy rain began to come down. I can only imagine how unhappy those people were about 30 minutes later when torrential rain began pounding down.


We were lucky to snag the last two-top in an indoor cafe where we were able to enjoy a hearty lunch and Cassis’ famous locally-grown white wine (quite tasty!) as we waited out the storm. Admittedly, it was much more fun to watch the lightning from inside.

As we slowly drove out of town through mini lakes of water, it became clear that the town was not prepared for — nor experiences many — weather events like that one. Nevertheless, it provided a much needed “cool down” that we enjoyed for the rest of the day back in Aix. Anticipating our long day of travel ahead, we relaxed at home for the remainder of the day and evening. Simultaneously sad to be leaving the land of buttery croissants but looking forward to Seattle summer and getting back to our (new) routines. A bientot! -->
