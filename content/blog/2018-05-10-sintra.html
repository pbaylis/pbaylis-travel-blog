<p>Took a day off of work to visit Sintra and avoid the weekend crowds. Tried to get up early to avoid the later-day crowds. Neither really workedâ€¦ there were crowds regardless. But, Sintra is pretty incredible. Sort of a romantic retreat for Portuguese royalty and royal hangers-on in the 18th and 19th centure. Started out with a long walk up the very beautiful Vila Saletti, followed by a tour of the Palace de Pena. Palace is wild - mixes many different styles, actually relatively recent for castles in Western Europe (18th centre).</p>

<p>Stop #2 was the Castle of the Moors, which was from a considerably easier period (11th centre) and much less well preserved, as you might expect. Slightly lower than Pena but I think it had better views. Then, back down through the forest to check out the Quinta de Regalaria, which was the most interesting so far, mainly because it has a network of hidden tunnels on the grounds. Really unique.</p>

<p>Had a piriquita (after the counter-lady screwed with me for a couple minutes before revealing that she spoke perfect english). It was a tasty pastry.</p>
