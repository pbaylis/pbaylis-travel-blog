Another work day! Struggling with finalizing the results of my job market paper. This thing is an albatross! I worked from home in the morning, then wrote some postcards and walk to the PO to mail them. Then continued on the Copenhagen Coffee Lab. This was my second visit to it - itâ€™s a very bougie-American cafe, which is less to my taste here than it would be back home. Delicious looking pastries and breads though, much more attractive than the cold pizza slice I had before coming here. Nice cortado. Most people speak english, though, which is a bit odd. In the evening, Sam and I went on a fantastic run up to an abandoned restaurant in a park with an insane view of the city - Parc Panoramique de Monsanto. Great running trails, too, and almost nobody there! Wild.

We then came back to the casa and hung out, had dinner (chicken! rice! salad!) before working a bit more.
