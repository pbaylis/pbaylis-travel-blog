<p>A bit of a sleepy day with some walking around the city. A bit limited today due to digestive concerns, but Emma and I took care of some errands and found a local gym. Found an aqueduct, though!</p>

<p>That night, we went out to watch an intratown soccer rivalry between the two local teams. The restaurant bar owner was very accomodating, moving a table basically inside the entryway to let us see the television, and shooing away other patrons when they blocked our view.</p>

<p>Lisbon is just an enjoyable city to wander around - tiles (<em>azulejos</em>) everywhere!</p>
