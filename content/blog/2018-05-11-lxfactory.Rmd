Back to work today. Slept in until 8:30, it was delightful. Wrote for 30 minutes and prepared a todo list for the day before heading out. Emma and I (and soon after, Josh), went to LXFactory, a hip area of shops, cafes, restaurants, and bars mostly frequented by young people. We worked from there for the morning - super pleasant. Then we walked back to the house and worked a bit more before I left to meet up with Sam to run.

Unexpected bonus today: Jenna Fullerton got in touch due to a family e-mail chain, since she and her boyfriend Jeremy were visiting Lisbon. They met us at this delicious Mexican place for dinner (Pistola y Corazon), which was also in a hip and crowded area… but the food was on point. Maybe the best I’ve had all trip. Jenna and Jeremy just arrived from 3 days in Madrid, where they saw a Flamenco show and a bullfight. Here they’ve walked around the Alfama and went to Sintra, and tonight they’ll go to a Fado show and then go to a club that doesn’t even start “going” until 2:30am. They invited us out, but… we old.
