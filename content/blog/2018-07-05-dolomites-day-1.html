<p>Woke up early with excitement (Pat) or slept clear until 7 (Erin), with ambitions to head out early to avoid predicted bad weather in the afternoon. We left Pension Angelo and walked through the still-sleeping town of Corvara to find our bus. Corvara is a ski town that seems to be typical of the Dolomiti area, with legions of four or five story condo buildings that stand mostly unoccupied in summer but fill up with Europeans during the high winter season.</p>
<p>The bus that picked us up was more charter than city bus, and navigated the switchbacks and altitude changes of the region with surprising deftness. We took in our first real impressions of the Dolomites from the front seats of the bus, as over the next hour we wound our way up through a series of similarly cute towns nestled amongst quickly rising peaks, deep forests, and flowing pastures. And sheep! The region itself is not unusually high as far as ski areas go: our hiking itinerary will range from around 5,000 to 8,000 feet, and most peaks top out below 10,000 (though there are exception). What catches the eye is the contrast, rock formations rising up impossible-to-climb angles and seeming to lean over the surrounding towns.</p>
<p>The bus dropped us off Passo Falzarego, where we started on hiking route 414. The itinerary we’re taking is laid out in great detail by the “self-guided” tour company we hired, Collett’s, and is described by incredibly detailed maps and instructions. These instructions hardly seemed necessary when we arrived, since the whole area is extremely well-signed, with hiking routes identified by numbers and intersections labeled with directions to the nearest landmarks. The maps and descriptions are nevertheless delightful (and ended up being the envy of other travelers) and gave us a real sense of what we had signed ourselves up for.</p>
<p>Our first impression of walking in the Dolomites (aside: as a testament to their hardiness, Europeans do not “hike”, they “walk”) is that there very few flat paths. For almost the entire day, we were either gaining or losing altitude, often steeply. Our first stop of the day was at Rifigio Averau, which dated back to the WW1 period and was used to shuttle supplies up the mountain to troops stationed there.</p>
<p>Averau makes sense as a stronghold: it overlooks much of the valley below, and would be a significant challenge to any incoming troops. As a place to eat, sleep, and consume espressos, it boggles American minds. What kind hotel sits on top of a mountain? What’s more is that Averau was relatively pedestrian compared to nearby Rifugio Nuvalau, which actually sits on a massif which <em>itself</em> overlooks Averau and presumably has an even more stunning and complete view of the area! Feeling some time pressure, we didn’t go up, but we would see it from all angles for nearly the rest of the trip. We took in the views and an espresso with our new Australian friends, Drew and Amy, who now live in Bali and were doing a similar route to ours while six months pregnant.</p>
<p>The next stretch descended from Averau down a steep switchback trail before turning towards a wildflower meadow and winding our way up and down to our second Refugio, Passo Giau, just under halfway through the day, where we collected lunch and a cappuccino before crossing over the road to our next area, where we found the best stretch of the day. This next part was a slow, rolling descent through a meadow with soft terrain and escarpment to our left, we saw many contented cows, a healthy number of marmots, and incredible views to the south of the striking geology that characterizes the area. Most notable was an uplift that looked something like a massive spaceship or ramp to nowhere, enormous and green.</p>
<p>And, the flowers! We heard from some other guests that they came at this time of year primarily for the wildflowers, and they didn’t disappoint. Though we are sad to report that we are terrible botanists, we can verify that there is a wide array of very pretty flowers in the Dolomites in July. Also, the cows and their bells are absolutely delightful. And it’s all of these things together that seem to make this area so special. There’s no doubt that the geology is spectacular, but what’s really striking is the variety of landscapes and color that make the Dolomites so inviting.</p>
<p>As if on cue, we finished the meadow stretch with the promised thunderstorm bearing down, so hustled through a pass and turned north to follow the curl of the mountain range and to make it to shelter. The descent was gorgeous, with the mountains again to our west and a pasture area to the east, but we were mostly concerned with escaping the oncoming lightning. We made it to Rigugio Croda de Lago just as the storm settled in, which left us lots of time for relaxing, napping, and reading before dinner at 7, which was a classic Italian and possibly slightly Austrian meal with pasta, polenta, and grappa. With tired legs and full stomachs, we went to bed early for another early day tomorrow.</p>
