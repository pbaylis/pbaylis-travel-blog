We flew directly from Seattle to London Gatwick -- Erin managed to sleep a little, but Pat ... did not (but was very productive). With the time change, we arrived i London at about 6:45am, so after collecting our large checked suitcase and depositing it at the airport, we headed out with our backpacks for a day of exploring! Or a half day. Or however long we could stay awake. 

Highlights of our London walk:

- We were drawn into a pilot for an online television series called Magical Bones. Started with a card trick where he reproduced two cards of our each, which was impressive by itself. But the next trick stole the show, where he did some sleight of hand with a coin, bouncing it back and forth between his hands and his eye(!), but the showstopper was when he had me write our initials on a coin and placed it in my hand, closing it tightly. Then, when I opened my hand up... the coin was bent! We were baffled.
- Otherwise, we walked around from London Bridge, saw Westminister Abbey, Big Ben (which was under construction), and Buckingham Palace.
- We were near (but didn't go in) the museum of modern art, the Tate 
- We mostly finished our excursions with a trip to Hyde Park, where were lay down and ended up napping for a couple hours.
- We also ate Pret a Manger three times. Very typical London fare.

We took an express train back to the airport and had our EasyJet flight to Venice, which was actually completely reasonable despite its reputation as a budget carrier. After a helpful bus driver helped us figure out how to make it to our hotel, we dragged our suitcase up and down a number of Venice bridges before arriving to a (slightly surly) hotel concierge, probably because he had to let us in so late. In our defense, we did pay him 25 Euro. Thankfully the room was nice and, importantly, had air conditioning and we quickly fell asleep.
