An early morning departure from SFO had me into Vancouver at 10am. With baggage in tow (my rolling travel suitcase and the new Patagonia carry-on sized bag), I took the train up to Vancouver City Centre and the 16 bus east on Hastings to Tasia and Marc's place. East Hastings can be a rough and stands in striking contrast to the west side of Vancouver. But there's something homey about it too, and rolling back towards to Commercial Drive area gave me an opportunity to reflect on why I enjoy spending time over there.

I had a few hours to kill before I needed to head back to Tsawwassen to catch my 7:15pm ferry. First stop was back to Tasia and Marc's, where I reunited with Wilbur the Baby Crow, who had recently become Wilbur the Adolescent Crow and learned to fly. He still won't shut up and still demands to be fed.

Then I headed down to Brittania Fitness Centre on Commercial and got in a much more successful lift than the one at Reunion. At least in the sense of not completely seizing up my muscles, though I didn't feel particularly strong at any point. After a quick shower I biked back up to East Hastings to visit Pallet Coffee Roasters, my current favorite coffee place. It closed at 3pm, and for most of the time I was the sole customer. I cranked through a few work tasks before returning to Tasia and Marc's to repack my stuff. After a brief hello with Marc, I headed off on bike with my large travel pack (the Patagonia pack above) on my back. My plan was to pick up groceries near the Cambie and Broadway train station, then take the train (with bike and pack and groceries) to the 620 bus. This was not a good plan.

With two bags of groceries, I ended up at the train station right at peak rush hour and with a bike, and had to wait for three trains to go by before I managed to squeeze into the middle of a train to YVR. Still, I finally made it on and headed south until Bridgeport, where I found the 620 waiting area. Apparently the bus fills up at times, because there is a painted maze for customers to line up, but fortunately this day there were relatively few other customers. I boarded and transited to Tsawwassen without incident. In the future, though, I will skip the pre-ferry grocery run if I have a bike, and just pay the premium on the island. But since I later found out Kathy and Don have bikes on the island, I should probably just not bring a bike at all.

The ferry ride was beautiful and clear as usual, but the main highlight was the brief appearance of two Orcas alongside the ferry, heading the opposite way on the western edge of the S curve on the western edge of Mayne Island...! I'm not sure if I've ever seen them in the wild before, so this was a pretty amazing treat. No pictures, though this is roughly where they were.

Post ferry and orcas, I found the truck parked as advertised and drove to Don and Kathy's cabin, where Penny was waiting for me. First, though I watered the cedar trees per Don's request, and then settled in for the evening.
