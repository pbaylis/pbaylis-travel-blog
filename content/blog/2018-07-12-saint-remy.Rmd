## A Water-ful recipe for Provence charm
Off we set to Saint Remy for a view of the town in the daylight. Small, and enclosed in a circular road, it didn’t take us long to explore the city in it’s entirety. Don’t get us wrong, it was adorable (minus the terrible circus music emitted from carousel loudspeakers at 9am) but something was missing.

L’isle sur la Sorgue was our next stop. Known for antiqueing, the town also had a market that day which provided motivation for the 30 minute drive. Arrival to the city was like a deep sigh — this was somehow better. Why? Water always seems to win. With the Sorgue river — surprisingly, partially man made — running through the middle of town and waterwheels dotting the main walking path, we felt refreshed (despite remaining dry). Our only regret was not arriving earlier so as to purchase more goods at the local market, which included not just fruits, cheese, and saucisson, but olive wood cutting boards, scarves, and lavender sachets. After collecting ample supplies for a picnic, we made our way to a more remote part of the river to enjoy the “natural” beauty further.

The day only continued to improve, with a trip down to Ville des Baux. Here, we took in an artful audio visual show of Picasso and the Spanish greats, whose works were projected onto huge walls of a dark, enclosed limestone quarry. Experiential art, it was. We were able to freely walk around the huge quarry, enjoying new views from different heights and positions. There had to have been 40+ projectors in use inside the space, resulting in an incredibly varied visual landscape with very little image repetition. Hunks of limestone carved out of the quarry many years ago were used to build the nearby medieval village. From the show venue we also learned why the city was known as the city of “baux,” which, in this case stands for bauxite — a mineral found in the region.

Our espresso must have been extra-caffeinated that day. Despite all that had already been accomplished, we took a quick dip in our resort-like airbnb pool, showered off, and make the 30 minute walk back into Saint Remy to give the town another try - this time at night.

After comparing menus at about six different sidewalk bistros, we settled on a spot with a decently priced “formule.” For appetizers, fried zucchini flowers with a yogurt dipping sauce and some sort of eggplant tomato soufflé. The souffle won round one. For entrees, we got a tuna steak and durade sauté — both excellent. The wine, however, may have been the star of the night. It met all of my requirements for being “barn-yard-y” on the nose, dark and complex on the palate, and as smooth as could be. A lovely, yet semi-dangerous stroll home along the busy street led to brief stargazing by the pool. This may have been our most action-packed day yet!


## Arles you with me?
Daytrip #2 from our Saint Remy launching pad led us to the medieval town of Arles, renowned for it’s Roman ruins. Reminiscent of the colosseum, yet much smaller in scale, the village is home to an arena that still hosts bull fights and other performances today. City officials were setting up for a live music performance later that evening in the Roman amphitheater, but because payment was required for entry to all of these sites, the city felt more touristy and less inviting than we had hoped. Further, the great size of the Rhône made the city’s water feature feel more industrial than charming.

Our greatest find was a hippie outdoor environmental festival taking place in a courtyard under trees. We took shelter from the heat of the sun, ate very reasonably priced veggie plates (julienned zucchini and beets, lentil salad, fresh lettuce, and a slice of foccocia-like tomato bread) and enjoyed live music along with toddlers, grandfathers, and other tourists.
Post-lunch we set out for Moulin à Huile d' Olive du Calanquet — an olive farm and cave where we were treated to an in-depth, excellent tour (in French!) on how they produce their oil on site. We were able to see all of the machinery used in the process — mostly tubes — that contained the relevant blades to grind and then “Malaxe” (a churning process that prevents emusification) the olives. I always knew that you should look for “first cold-press” on extra virgin olive oil bottles as a mark of quality, but it wasn’t until this tour that I learned why. At warmer temperatures, the olive oil maker is able to extract greater quantities of oil, but at the expense of the oil’s quality. A centrifuge is used twice, first to separate the olive skin and meat from the oil and water mixture, and again to separate the olive oil from the vegetable water. The farm was committed to reducing waste, and actually uses the dried olive meats as fuel (for burning!) and fertilizer. Our guide was clear that the olive meat skin byproduct from the oil making process is not the same olives used for tapenade. Tapenade olives are cured in a completely separate process.

But that wasn’t even “ol-ive” the fun! We haven’t even gotten to the tasting. We sampled six different oils — 3 “dolce” (or soft) and 3 that were more bold. It was amazing how different each one tasted. The softest tasted like butter — no bite at all. Then they became increasingly spicy but with different accent flavors, such as artichoke. Our favorite was “Pitchouline” which we bought a large canister of for what is likely to be rapid consumption back in the states. We concluded our tour with even more samples of their homemade fruit vinegars, mustards, tapenades, and confitures (jams).

That evening, we ventured to the town of Eygaliers, which Pat termed “the Martha’s vineyard of Provence.”

Indeed, we quickly noticed the stylish, white-shirt wearing French dining out on the quaint roads. This town felt much more posh and wealthy than others we had explored. We were surprised to find long communal picnic tables lined up in the main square, and learned that it was town’s beginning of Bastille Day celebrations (apparently they let the fun start the eve before). Oddly, paella was the communal dinner being served that night. What happened to French cuisine on their day of national freedom? Music and dancing ensued — likely til late in the evening — but we made our way home early to crawl into bed.

## Sur le pont, d’Avignon…
... one now pays to take selfies rather than dance.

Our Avignon exploration was timely — it was during the middle of the city’s most important arts festival of the year. As we learned from one friendly Frenchman while waiting in line for buckwheat crepe, “this festival is the only time of year when French people talk to each other. And it’s to ask what shows and performances are the best.” Flyer after flyer after street performance teaser vied for our attendance. Unfortunately, due to our required 7pm check-in deadline at our Aix-en-Provence airbnb, we weren’t able to stay for any shows, but our whole city walk was like one big show in itself! Beat boxers, dancers, and drummers all kept us entertained. We learned that “le pont” used to have 20 arches, not just the four that remain following a detrimental flood. Lucky for us, the lack of bridge connecting one side of the river to the other has been supplemented with a free ferry, which we happily enjoyed.

Avignon, buzzing with all the art and culture, also felt younger than many other Provence towns we had visited thus far. We took lunch as a trendy spot called Milk Shop — apparently popular with many of the students in Avignon — and were even able to find the elusive iced latte later in the afternoon, a sure sign of American influence.

In the absence of formal show attendance, we did explore the funky, intriguing interior of an old mansion-turned-art-gallery. Though the collection had lent some of it’s Picasso and Cezanne pieces to other shows in the region, there was still an abundance of art to enjoy, including a striking drawing of “Les Danseues” on green paper. My favorite part of the gallery was the top floor, which contained modern, math-inspired art. Perhaps my favorite piece was a “paint-by-numbers” like composition using Pi to dictate which color line came next in a brigade of colorful stripes.

After a quick drive to Aix, a meet and greet with our airbnb host and a few minutes of relaxation, we rushed off to a highly reviewed restaurant at the bottom of old town that was able to squeeze us in for a reservation at the last minute. One delightful, charming waitress was working the entire restaurant — le Gambetta — and we were thoroughly impressed by her ability to manage everything. We enjoyed steak tartare, salmon, lots of bread, and more good wine.
