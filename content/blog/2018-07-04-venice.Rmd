A morning in Venice! We woke up early after a good night's sleep (for both) and headed out to catch a bit of Venice before the crowds and heat arrived. We only partially missed both of them, but were able to make it to the main plaza -- which is stunning -- and around the town a bit before returning to our hotel room to pack up.

Highlights included:

- That European yogurt is extra-delicious and we don't know why
- The many beautiful Murano glass we saw around the city
- All of the boating life around the city

Weird in San Marcos square: apparently one form of busking in the city is to throw seed to the pigeons there, and then give it to tourists (really, to shove it in their palm) so that the pigeons will land on the tourist for a photo op. Hard pass, says Erin!

After the morning walk, we went back to our hotel to pack up and deposit our bags with the staff for further unencumbered excursioning. Wandering to just a couple shops in the heat thoroughly worked us over, so we headed for an early lunch at a waterside restaurant (yes, most restaurants in Venice are waterside...). Filled with gorgonzola gnocchi (Pat) and vegetables (Erin), plus an Aperol Spritz (Pat), we committed ourselves to lazing around Venice for the rest of the afternoon. We ended up on the north side of the island, where we found an almost entirely untrafficked park and napped on a bench for an hour or so. It's fairly difficult to get away from the throngs of people in Venice, especially the main sights, so finding a shady, quiet park felt like an enormous bonus.

But, it was finally time to collect our bags and go, so we returned to the hotel and made our way towards the ferries for an alternate form of transportation back to the airport. After a slight snafu with choosing the correct dock to wait at, we took a reasonably speedy (30 min, where the bus was about 25 min) boat back. Although more spendy and less air-conditioned, the ferry (really a large powerboat) gave us a better sense for the other islands and areas around Venice, many of which are populated! Highlights en route included an  island entirely devoted to a cemetary, and Murano island, famous for its glass.

After rendezvous-ing with Ben, a staff member at Colletts (who set up our Dolomites hike), and the group of other hikers, we were off in a shuttle to Corvara and Colletts headquarters at Pension Angelo. It was a mostly sleepy, uneventful ride, with a walk through Gordo halfway there, and some ominous storms en route. One observation about our entrance into the Dolomites: they are _dramatic_. The towns en route to Corvara are beautiful and remarkably built into the landscape, even very high up and without obvious entrance points, while the peaks seem to almost loom over the scenery. The steepness is hard to compare to anything in the states. After a short delay for a landslide, we made it to Corvara. The place is clearly a mountain town, and filled with beautiful, well-built chalets like ours. We were treated to a dinner with a group of other hikers, continuing to chat with our new English friends, David and Diana (?), until we convened with Beth, a staff member at Colletts, to discuss our plans tomorrow.

We went over the route in some detail, discussing where we'd stay, what to look out for, what buses to take and when, and most importantly (to us), how and when to bail out of a bad storm. There is some iffy weather on the way which we're hoping to avoid but in the worst case we'll head for lower ground to avoid thunderstorm threats. We spent the rest of the evening packing and ended up in bed around midnight with a 7am wakeup time. Tomorrow, into the mountains!
