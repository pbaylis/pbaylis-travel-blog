<p>Our second day in the Dolomites began at 6:30, getting ourselves ready so that we could take off soon after breakfast (since we were again facing a forecast of afternoon thunderstorms).</p>

<p>Since we’d never done any hut-to-hut hiking before, a little elaboration on the huts might be worthwhile. First, they are emphatically <em>not</em> huts. Even Rifugio Croda de Lago, which was the one of the smallest, tightest rifugios we’d seen, still housed at least 30 people (and likely more). What they are is very large chalets, with dormitories for bedrooms. A stay at one usually costs between 50 and 70 Euro for “half-board”, which means dinner (wine not included), a dorm bed, and breakfast in the morning. The dorms are invariably a little cramp, but the meals are full multi-course Italian spreads, starting with bread and olive oil, a primi (usually a pasta), a secondi (a main course, sometimes just a big hunk of meat), and the dessert. The breakfast spread this morning was nearly as impressive, with the mountaineers classic museli and yogurt, but also fresh croissants and hard boiled eggs, not to mention bread, meats, and cheese.</p>
<p>And these huts are <em>all over</em> the Dolomites. Even in just the small area we were hiking in, we ran across at least ten huts directly on our path and were within a few kilometers of another ten. So it’s no exaggeration to say that you could spend a month in the Dolomites at a different hut each night, if you planed for it. And they’re all unique! Some huts tend to be oriented more towards climbers, some towards hikers, some double as mountain restaurants since they’re served by roads and relatively accessible to towns nearby.</p>
<p>You might imagine that the experience of hut-hiking is considerably different than backpacking. And it is! With about 10 fewer pounds and a smaller pack, daytime movement is (obviously easier), though the nature of the Dolomites mitigates that benefit a bit. It also means that the mountain community experience, which is usually confined to the group you arrive with, can be more expansive; we found ourselves meeting and talking to a wide variety of travellers, most retirees and an astonishing number of those hailing from northern England (no kidding). And of course, eating a full meal and sleeping in a real bed makes between-day recovery much easier. If there is a tradeoff here, it’s that this in kind of hiking doesn’t have quite the same level of immersion that a backpacking trip, or, of course, the same feeling of self-sufficiency. Not that either is better or worse; they are simply different.</p>
<p>We do wonder a little while it is that the Dolomites (and many places in Europe) are fairly crawling with these huts, while there are almost none of this kind in North America. Hut-to-hut experiences make distance hiking much more accessible and enjoyable for a wider range of people. Our guess is that it’s a combination of geography, road distance, and the volume of foot traffic that’s required to support these huts.</p>

<p>At any rate, digression over. With full stomachs, we continued our path north along the lake through a delightful, wooded route before turning west around the escarment and steeply descending towards the valley floor. Even with hiking poles in hand, the sharp descents were hard on the knees, so we were glad when the path leveled out into a meadow and near the first of few small private cabins we saw today. After another half an hour we made it to a road, which was followed by a rapid ascent through a muddy, forested area; in the Dolomites, what goes down must come up!</p>

<p>The trail was lovely but slick after the rains, so when it finally leveled out into a gravel track near the second private cabin (picture below) and slowed its rate of ascent we were glad for that too. We stopped by Rifugio Cinque Torri, eponymously named for the iconic tower formation that was used heavily during WW1, to enjoy our morning cappuccino (Erin says, “that sweet sweet espresso”), and then continued northwest back in the direction of our original pass but on the opposite side of the mountain that housed Rifugio Averau. This was probably our favorite part of the day, with the constrast of the wildflowers popping out amidst the rocks, grass, and ski lifts.</p>

<p>Instead of going all the way back to our starting point, we turned north and descended through a forest until we intersected with a road, which we followed briefly until turning back onto the trail next to the now-abandoned Rifugio Laguzoi (creepy!).</p>

<p>The last stretch of our day brought us up the mountains opposite the road, and gave us a view of much of the hike we just finished. We got to pass through a rock tunnel, and across a huge boulder field, before finally making it to our stop for the night, Rifugio Dibona. Like Cinque Torri, Dibona is a center for climbers, and is also accessible by road so it wasn’t only hikers there with us. We completed the lunch-nap-dinner challenge, stuffing ourselves with a delicious venison ragu (Pat) and spinach ravioli (Erin).</p>
<p>We ended the evening with a walk and some rock throwing (Pat will be starting a fitness class based solely around throwing rocks) before chatting with our room companion, John, a charming retired gentleman from north England. He shares Pat’s passion for a carbon tax.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is our last day hiking! It will also be our longest, 18km, although perhaps more due to a required detour (a path is out).</p>
