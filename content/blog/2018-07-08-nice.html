<h2>A “rocky” start</h2>
<p>Having been tempted by glimpses of azure waters on our brief bus ride to Thiers (just North of old town), we quickly deposited our bags at our lovely Airbnb and prioritized the one thing that stood between us and the beach — growling stomachs. Upon recommendation from our Airbnb host George, we took a quick two block walk to a corner bistro where we had our first authentic Nicoise meal (pizza for Pat and Niçoise salad for Erin). Cool water on the brain, we swapped our airplane outfits for our maillot de bains and headed to the beach.</p>

<p>As a Californian, I was shocked when my feet hit not sand, but rocks as we came within a foot of the waves. Complaining about rocky beaches feels… wrong, but it was admittedly a more painful experience than expected. The water, on the other hand, was cool, clear, and an undeniably perfect temperature.</p>

<h2>Stepping down into old town</h2>
<p>Just as we wondered, “Mais, ou est tous les enfants?!” we stumbled upon the gorgeous public park that separates old town from “new,” and found… tous les enfants — playing soccer, performing interpretive dance, and triumphantly chasing pigeons. You cannot miss old town because you literally descend down stairs to enter the maze of old brick streets. For dinner, we dined in a hip French “hole-in-the wall” bistro spotted by Pat. 9 for ambiance, 8 for service, 6 for food, and 2 for quality of fish de-boning. Overall, wonderful experience with the highlight being the grapefruit spritz ordered by Pat (and hijacked by Erin).</p>

<h2>Always Nice-r with AC</h2>
<p>Our full day of Nice exploration began with a split morning workout (Pat with a run and Erin with a barre class video), followed by a mission to the Marché aux Fleurs — Nice’s longstanding flower market that now offers much more than flowers. We checked off our to-do list item to sample Socca — a chickpea flour “crepe” of sorts that is baked on a large castiron circle and cut into slices before being packed in a paper cone for easy carrying. I found myself wishing for some ketchup, Pat craved yogurt as a condiment. Overall, tasty, but a bit dry after stuffing several slices into your mouth in rapid succession — oops.</p>

<p>Climbing to the top of Nice’s castle lookout, we were shocked to find a public park with playgrounds and ice cream in addition to the royal ruins.</p>

<p>A brief fuel-up was required, and we happily ate Niçoise salad (round deux) and a burratta, pesto tartine to supplement our Socca snack. Dying to escape the heat, we decided to make our way to Musee Matisse. Confident that we would be able to leverage public transportation to make our way out of downtown, we were saddened by the never-appearing bus #17. Uber to the rescue. At Musee Matisse we learned of the Picasso celebration going on across France from 2017-2019. Museums, venues, and shows across the country were teaming together to feature his story and work. As a result, we enjoyed learning about Picasso and Matisse’s interwining lives, and fairly similar ventures into Fauvism. Artistic evidence was provided to show how both men challenged “the model,” with greater abstraction from their previous (more realistic) depictions of odalisques. I loved seeing how Matisse’s art became larger - in boldness and physical size - as he aged and ailed. La piscine - a life-size banner depicting swimmers diving in and out of water was Matisse’s way of enjoying the water and satisfying his love for swimming long after he was able to physically go to the pool. I was sufficiently inspired to take a crack at my own “cutout art” upon returning to Seattle — which sparked a whole separate investigation into international copyright law for art of deceased artists like Matisse.</p>

<p>That night, though tired, we managed to make our way back into old town for a bit of food and jazz. After some decent Mediterranean fare, Shapko offered us a jazz quartet and melange of French viewers — old and young — to enjoy the music along with.</p>

<h2>Mais oui, of course we Cannes!</h2>
<p>Day trip 1: Cannes! Le TGV (the French speed train) was our chauffeur as we made the quick journey to the sand-filled beaches town just a couple of stops away. For me, this morning would mark a momentous occassion — ‘twas on this morn that I first enjoyed a feuillette aux abricots, my new favorite pastry. Imagine an insanely flakey croissant — flattened, with flame-roasted, sweet-tart apricots laid atop (DROOL. I must try to replicate this in the states).</p>

<p>After defending our pastries from multiple pigeon attacks, we explored town. Hilly, we traversed up and down the back streets of Cannes — instinctively avoiding the more glamorous shops and film festival crowd. We discovered a delicious-looking restaurant - Tredici - that was sadly closed the day we were in town. Onto the “to-do” list it goes for our return trip!</p>

<p>The beach - public and free - was a true upgrade from our rockier experience in Nice. We remarked how crazy it is that geologically you can have natural sand and natural rock beaches so close to each other. For the late afternoon, we boarded a ferry that took us to the island of Sainte Marguerite. Home to campgrounds as well as an old town turned kid-summer-camp, we enjoyed yet another different perspective on Cannes.</p>

<p>Returning home, we cooked our own quinoa, salmon, goat cheese nectarine salad dinner and enjoyed a quieter night to ourselves.</p>

<h2>Day trip 2: The Medieval mindset</h2>
<p>Originally hoping to see and hike among waterfalls at Sud du Loup, we rented a car for the day and drove inland, up into the hills. Our day progressed from one medieval town to the next, starting with the most quaint — Gourdon — and ending with the largest and perhaps most modern — Vence. The medieval mindset from the eyes of a modern day traveler: impossibly cute, impossibly perched. These deteriorating, yet vibrant old villages looked as though they might just fall right off the ledge of the mountain they were built upon, erosion threatening their existence. Safe for now, each one offered a stunning view of Nice and environs as well as sufficient brick-road mazes to get lost in.</p>

<p>Exploring the backside of one of these towns, we found a hiking path — perhaps once used as a main thoroughfare for traveling between mountain villages — that led us down the hill toward what can best be described as hardened lava fields. The ashy rock was mysterious and abundant.</p>

<h2>Gorge-ous day en route to St. Remy</h2>
<p>Every time I stand up paddleboard, I remember how much slower it is than kayaking. Yet I somehow always allow the perfect amount of time pass in between outings such that I forget any frustration associated with the sport. My France experience proved no different, but was gorgeous, and peaceful all the same. Morning showers gave way to afternoon sunshine and a brisk wind as we arrived at Gorges du Verdon. We struck out onto the river with paddles in hand and quickly discovered that an afternoon workout was in store. The green-blue water and stunning limestone gorge kept our eyes satiated over the course of three hours of paddleboarding. Pat can even proudly claim successful “cliff jumper” status after scrambling up the rocky gorge wall and diving in. Little did he know he would also discover just how swift the gorge’s current was as he tried to catch up to me and the paddleboards that were effortlessly sprinting downriver. Time flew and before we knew it we were running late for a serendipitous meetup with two of my business school classmates who were traveling through Aix. Together, we dined at a unique, delightful restaurant that truly lived up to its name - drole de l’endroit - funny little place. The menu — presented on a 3 foot high blackboard, rolled from one table to the next — was varied and delicious. The highlight was the salmon gravalax — a Norwegian specialty where the salmon is “cooked” (cured?) using salt, but no heat. Too full and sleepy for dessert, we made the rest of our drive to our Saint Remy airbnb and we’re asleep in a flash.</p>
