<p>My last day in Portugal! I decided to go to Evora via train. Evora is a famous old-history town, with Roman ruins sitting at the top of town. Ran across a beautiful garden before heading into the city centre. After an hour spent trying to get change for a 100 (with eventual success at the bank), I was finally able to explore the town. The Roman ruins and the cathedral with the astonishing panorama of the city were my favourite parts of the experience. But after a few hours, well, I think I’ve seen most of Evora.</p>

<p>Church of Sao Francesco - cathedral of bones and the nativity scenes - very impressive. Franciscan monks.</p>

<p>Got home in time to meet Sam and Emma for dinner - we went back to LXFactory, where we went up to a rooftop bar with an insane view to the south (the bridge in Lisbon strongly resembles the Golden Gate). Then we went to the restaurant downstairs, where we had the best Portuguese meals so far. Delicious fried cheese balls, pickled mushrooms, some kind of pate, followed by roasted veggies, lamb, and an incredible bull (not cow!) tartare. A special meal to wrap up a special trip. Hard to believe it has already come to an end. We then headed up, said goodbye, and went to bed.</p>
