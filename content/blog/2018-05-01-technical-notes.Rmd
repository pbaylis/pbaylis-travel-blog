### Fix for image orientation problem
Neither blogdown nor Hugo automatically rotates images according EXIF metadata. The easiest solution I've found is to run `exiftran -ai *.jpg` on the directory of images in the static folder, which autorotates the images per the EXIF orientation flag and then sets it to 1. On Mac, `exiftran` can be install with `brew install exiftran`. 
### Editing image caption to sit closer to the image
  I shrunk the distance between the image and the caption and italicized the caption text by including the following in `override.css`

```{css, eval = FALSE}
div.figure {
  line-height: 1; 
}

p.caption {
  font-style: italic;
}

section.main .content .markdown .figure img {
  margin-bottom:0;
}
```

### Shrinking images
  This code lets me shrink images to smaller than the width of the container they live in.

```{md, eval = FALSE}
![Shrink images](/img/portugal/IMG_2944.jpg){width=400px}
```

![Shrunken image](/img/portugal/IMG_2944.jpg){width=400px}

### Changing Rmd posts
Remember to run serve site (from Addins toolbar in RStudio), otherwise netlify will serve old HTML file.
