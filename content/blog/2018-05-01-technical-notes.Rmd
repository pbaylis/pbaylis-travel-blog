# How this website works

I built this website using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), an [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) add-on.^[Actually a part of more recent versions of RStudio.] blogdown actually works as a kind of wrapper or interface to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator^[I previously used Jekyll, another static site generator. However, `blogdown` makes it easy to create websites using `markdown` that can incorporate code, which are useful for doing reproducible research and for teaching.]. I use a stripped down version of the [Cocoa Hugo Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/cocoa/).

The project code is stored in a Github [repository](http://github.com/pbaylis/travelogue). I can run at test it locally using blogdown, but for serving the site to the outside world I use [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com)

## How to get a floating TOC

This turned out to be such a pain in the ass that I gave up. See these links for background reading:

- https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2017/09/06/adding-r-markdown-documents-of-other-output-formats/
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48098137/import-stand-alone-rmd-own-repo-and-project-as-a-post-in-blogdown

If I _really_ want a floating TOC I'll just make it as a static file in Rmarkdown and link to it directly.
For blog posts, the plain on TOC will be fine.

Like, linking to my climate projection [post](/ext_posts/climate_projection_post.html). This actually works pretty well.

## Fix for image orientation problem

Neither blogdown nor Hugo automatically rotates images according EXIF metadata. The easiest solution I've found is to run `exiftran -ai *.jpg` on the directory of images in the static folder, which autorotates the images per the EXIF orientation flag and then sets it to 1. On Mac, `exiftran` can be install with `brew install exiftran`.

## Editing image caption to sit closer to the image

  I shrunk the distance between the image and the caption and italicized the caption text by including the following in `override.css`

```{css, eval = FALSE}
div.figure {
  line-height: 1;
}

p.caption {
  font-style: italic;
}

section.main .content .markdown .figure img {
  margin-bottom:0;
}
```

## Shrinking images
  This code lets me shrink images to smaller than the width of the container they live in.

```{md, eval = FALSE}
![Shrink images](/img/portugal/IMG_2944.jpg){width=400px}
```

![Shrunken image](../img/portugal/IMG_2944.jpg){width=400px}



## Changing Rmd posts
Remember to run serve site (from Addins toolbar in RStudio), otherwise netlify will serve old HTML file.
