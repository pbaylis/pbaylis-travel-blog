I arrived in Lisbon ("Lisboa") about 18 hours before Sam and Emma returned from their respective trips, so I had a night and most of a day to explore solo. 

I thought that the first night would mostly be going to sleep, but when I got in to my tiny AirBNB room in Alfama around 10 I went out looking for food. Alfama is a very cute, fairly touristy area with lots of little winding streets and virtually impassible for cars.

It’s also one of the centers for "Fado", traditional Portuguese music - sort of a Portuguese version of the blues. I went to a restaurant called Estaca Zero where there was a rotating cast of musicians from about 8 pm to midnight. The food was pretty good, but more importantly the vibe was welcoming and the music was excellent. The group seemed to know each other well, and it definitely seemed like people more or less walked in off the street to perform. I stayed about two and a half hours before walking back to the AirBNB, after a slight detour up into the upper parts of Alfama to get a view out over the water.

Lisbon seems remarkably safe — people (of both genders) were wandering around well past midnight. I also really like the streets and sidewalks: they are almost exclusively a mix of sizes of cobblestones - very little pavement or asphalt. And the red of the roofs is gorgeous. Must be great for their urban heat index...
