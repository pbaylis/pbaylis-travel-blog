<p>No avoiding the weather with an early start today, since it rained all day. The route today retraced our steps from yesterday (not the original plan, but the thunderstorms had wiped out the trail we’d planned to take), and then turned north to hike down a stream that we stayed with for most of the day. The pass turning north included a number of fascinating WW1-era trenches and battlements, where the Italian and Austrian armies fought for control of the region. After that, we walked for much of the day next to stream which soon became a small river which became a series of stunning waterfalls which finally ended as a much larger river.</p>
<p>Without the rain, this might have been the prettiest stretch of the hike. With the rain, it was still very beautiful, but we’d be lying if we said we weren’t wishing for sunshine! Still, even with the rain, the color of the river was a striking turqoise, similar to the a Mediterranean sea blue.</p>
<p>We were also able to do our only <em>Via Ferrata</em> of the trip. Translated directly, “Via Ferrata” means “iron path”, and is a protected climbing route often seen in this region of Europe. Protected here means that someone has installed a series of bolts and ropes so that hikers can attach themselves using harnesses in caribiners. Of course, we didn’t have either of those, so the Ferrata we attempted today was one of the ones rated as sufficiently safe to do without protection if one so choice. We weren’t willing to take our full packs on it, so we instead ventured out packless, rounding a slightly terrifying corner above the gorge with hands gripped tightly to a steel cable before making it to a path that went fully behind an enormous waterfall. Next time, we’ll bring gear.</p>
<p>The last 5km after the Ferrata were a smooth downhill, where we met our taxi driver Marco, who brought us into Cortina D’Ampezzo, the nearest and largest town in the area. He was kind enough to both show us the bus station <em>and</em> the location of the best pastry shop in town, where we learned that Italian hot chocolate is really just slightly thinned chocolate syrup with whipped cream on top. Cortina feels like a small version of Whistler, and according to Marco has 6,000 residents in the summer (low season) and 45,000 residents (!) in the winter, when the Italians who have their second homes up here come up from the south. We spent an hour there and it was enough.</p>
<p>Our final stop in the Dolomites was in Badia as Haus Valentin, another Collett’s chalet. We had dinner with a small group and played a quick game of scrabble with one of the other guests before turning in early, since we leave tomorrow 5:45am for Venice airport and then to Nice!</p>
