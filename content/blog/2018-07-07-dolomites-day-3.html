<ul>
<li>Retraced steps because road was out</li>
<li>North through a pass that included WW1-era trenches and battlements</li>
<li>Eventually joined up with a stream that we stayed with for most of the day, as it transitioned from stream to small river to waterfalls to bigger waterfalls to very large river</li>
<li>Mostly downhill - our knees!</li>
<li>Turquoise color of water</li>
<li>Did our only <em>Via Ferrata</em> (but one of the easy ones so we didnâ€™t need hardnesses and ropes)</li>
<li>Stayed in Badia, just up the road from Corvara</li>
<li>Pippa played scrabble with us after dinner</li>
<li>5:45am departure time!</li>
</ul>
