Slept in, then headed out northwest past Sintra (it was Emma’s day to plan). After, of course, a quick stop by McDonald’s for a McFlurrie (again, it was Emma’s day to plan). Then we went on the best trail run / walk / hike ever. We started out near Cabo de Roca, the westernmost point in Europe (but did not to the town, which seemed to already be overrun with tourists) and headed North up the coast to Praia de Ursa, a gorgeous (and seemingly semi-nude) beach that reminded me of Muir Beach in Marin. In fact, many parts of this day reminded me of the Northern California coastline - Marin or Santa Cruz (Wilder Ranch in particular).

We made our further north through a small variety of terrain and with no end of heart-thumping views, including one very, very large drop-off in to the ocean - the only time I’ve ever seen caution railings in Portugal. We also unexpectedly happened across some dinosaur tracks that had been laid and then upturned by seismic activity.

After about four hours of meanderings inland we made our way back to the car. From there we headed further north, looking for food. We were planning to find a restaurant on the coast, but instead happened across a little farmers market where we had one of our best meals yet - an italian place on the side of the road staffed by, well, hippies. Hippies who make damn good pizza, and salad. After another hour basking in the sun with some vinos and our food, we continued further north to a bar on Praia de Adraga, which we had overlooked earlier on the hike. And then home and to bed. Maybe the best day of the trip…!
