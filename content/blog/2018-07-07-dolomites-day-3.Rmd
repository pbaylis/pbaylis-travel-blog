- Retraced steps because road was out
- North through a pass that included WW1-era trenches and battlements
- Eventually joined up with a stream that we stayed with for most of the day, as it transitioned from stream to small river to waterfalls to bigger waterfalls to very large river
- Mostly downhill - our knees!
- Turquoise color of water
- Did our only _Via Ferrata_ (but one of the easy ones so we didn't need hardnesses and ropes)
- Stayed in Badia, just up the road from Corvara
- Pippa played scrabble with us after dinner
- 5:45am departure time!
