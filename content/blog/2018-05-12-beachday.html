<p>Definitely NOT a work day! Ate a delicious Sam-cooked breakfast before heading out on a Sam-planned adventure. We rented a car (relatively cheap!) and drove south across the bridge to Praia de Baleeira, a remote, rocky beach with a windy and not entirely straightforward descent. Day was gorgeous. Once we got down to the bottom there were a bunch of scuba divers. There were some remnants of old buildings that we couldn’t figure out the purpose of. Next stop was another, even more scenic (but somewhat more crowded sandy beach called Rebiera Do Cavalo Beach where we picnicked, lay on the sand, and briefly hopped in the water.</p>

<p>Also made another stop in the nearby resort town, where we went a largely unremarkable walk, except for the excellent long jumping platform we discovered. On the way back to town we went to Ponto Finale, a restaurant with a gorgeous view of the city, where we had a couple of soups while sitting next to the water. A long discussion of quantitative and qualitative research and economics’ place in social science ensued.</p>
