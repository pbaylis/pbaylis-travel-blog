## More Aix-ploration

The next day we aimed to take in Aix in the daylight - something we hadn’t yet been able to do. A brief morning run to explore some of Cezanne’s painting lookouts and old city ruins was followed by rapid consumption of les pains at chocolat and brunch. By noon, the French were already out on the streets in their blue, white, and red, ready to cheer their beloved team on in the World Cup final. Three hours before the game began, chanting and singing was already echoing off the city walls.
Determined to take in a little more history before the game commenced, we paid for entry into Cezanne’s atelier. Haven been born and having died in Aix, we learned that Cezanne really was — and still is — Aix’s “golden boy.” The atelier was just one room, but rich in objects of interest. Huge windows ensured ample light, and on one corner of the room, you could see the curious notch that had been cut out of the exterior wall to allow Cezanne to get his massive canvases outside — so as to see all the brilliant colors he was painting with in full sunlight (see photo below). From old letters he had written to Monet to easels and painting coats, it was really special to peer into his life years ago.

It goes without saying that we capped off our day by watching France dominate in the World Cup! This marks the second time France has won and the second time Pat has been in France when they’ve won! 2 for 2!

## An Aix-cellent Finish

Our final daytrip led us out to the coastal city of Cassis — a more “lowkey” version of Cannes with the added bonus of calanques -- dramatic, limestone-lined inlets. What we initially thought might be an easy stroll turned into a three hour hike along the coast, providing awesome views of the turquoise blue waters and soaring cliffs that make up the calanques - or inlets - that the region is known for. Midway through the hike, rolling thunder and lightning strikes began threatening us. We were shocked to see people still headed out to the water/into the national park as heavy rain began to come down. I can only imagine how unhappy those people were about 30 minutes later when torrential rain began pounding down.

We were lucky to snag the last two-top in an indoor cafe where we were able to enjoy a hearty lunch and Cassis’ famous locally-grown white wine (quite tasty!) as we waited out the storm. Admittedly, it was much more fun to watch the lightning from inside.

As we slowly drove out of town through mini lakes of water, it became clear that the town was not prepared for — nor experiences many — weather events like that one. Nevertheless, it provided a much needed “cool down” that we enjoyed for the rest of the day back in Aix. Anticipating our long day of travel ahead, we relaxed at home for the remainder of the day and evening. Simultaneously sad to be leaving the land of buttery croissants but looking forward to Seattle summer and getting back to our (new) routines. A bientot!
