<p>A morning in Venice! We woke up early after a good night’s sleep (for both) and headed out to catch a bit of Venice before the crowds and heat arrived. We only partially missed both of them, but were able to make it to the main plaza – which is stunning – and around the town a bit before returning to our hotel room to pack up. Highlights included:</p>
<ul>
<li>That European yogurt is extra-delicious and we don’t know why</li>
<li>The many beautiful Murano glass we saw around the city</li>
<li>All of the boating life around the city</li>
</ul>
<p>Weird in San Marcos square: apparently one form of busking in the city is to throw seed to the pigeons there, and then give it to tourists (really, to shove it in their palm) so that the pigeons will land on the tourist for a photo op. Hard pass!</p>
