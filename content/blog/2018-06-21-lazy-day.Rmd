My first full day on Mayne started with a... slight stomachache. I courageously recovered by staying in bed for another hour. Then, trying not to entirely waste the day, I took Penny out and we went for a jog up to Vulture Ridge, which is in the (very) near park at the edge of Don and Kathy's place. Although she wasn't exactly game for the full speed sprint up the hill, she did follow along at her pace, and we crested to the lookout point where a fantastic view south towards Pender Island was waiting for us.

The day mostly went downhill from there. I tried to work while simultaneously watching the World Cup, and failed at both. I'm not sure I enjoyed the games much (do I even like watching soccer?), and I definitely didn't get much done. I think I had hoped that this time would be fantastically productive, but if it will be, then today was not a good start. I also am working on my latte technique, which has barely gotten off the ground. I think that I'm struggling to reliably build microfoam.

Still, even in the midst of non-productivity, it's hard to argue with this setting. As much time and expense as this place no doubt requires, the view from their house out over the water is worth almost any price. And the whole place is thoughfully appointed with a lovely mid-century modern aesthetic (did I really just type that?).

My attempt at getting outside mostly bombed, though, when I attempted to go out on one of the kayaks. First, I didn't bring a skirt and the waves were high enough that water got into the kayak almost immediately and continued to get in the kayak. With cold and wet pants, I only made it about 100m offshore. Plus, bringing the kayak in and out of the water was painful since I didn't have water shoes. Tomorrow, I will do better: I'll have a skirt (and a pump), hopefully some water-ready shoes, and I'll actually remember to flip down the rudder this time. What a novelty. Still, at least Penny enjoyed coming down to the beach to watch me struggle.

I ended the day with a quick trip over to the grocery store to pick up milk (for more latte attempts) and chicken (for dinner). On the way back I was compelled to stop for a picture of a gorgeous inland farm area.
