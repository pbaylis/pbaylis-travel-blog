title: "Nova talk and shopping"

<p>I woke up early to prep for my talk at Nova, arriving around 10:30 to meet Antonieta C. de Sa. We had a nice chat over coffee before heading up for an hourlong seminar with the (larger than expected) environment/resources group they have at the school. The group was engaged and lively, which was fun. We had lunch afterwards in the university cafe, where I heard about their new building and some wild trips through Russia and India. Lesson from the latter is to not drive across India.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I went on a shopping spree, in search or cork, Portuguese wool scarves, pottery, and azulejos.</p>

<p>I succeeded in finding those things, and after a brief work session in the park to prepare for these defense tonight (and an even briefer call with one of my undergraduate research assistants, who probably didn’t imagine that I was sitting in a park up near the top of the Alfama), met up with Sam and Emma at an “underground” Chinese restaurant near the Martim Moniz station, which is a bit downscale (and preferable) to its neighbour Baixa. The restaurant was underground in the sense that it was basically in an apartment, with no visible markings outside to indicate it - you just had to know. It may have actually been bootleg at one point, but these days it’s apparently just part of the experience. I assume they’re all normally regulated, since it wasn’t particularly challenging to find out about, per Kanner.</p>
