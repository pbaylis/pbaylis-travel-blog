# Portugal Travel Blog

## Thursday May 3
I arrived in Lisbon (“Lisboa”) about 18 hours before Sam and Emma returned from their respective trips, so I had a night and most of a day to explore solo. I thought that the first night would mostly be going to sleep, but when I got in to my tiny AirBNB room in Alfama around 10 I went out looking for food. Alfama is a very cute, fairly touristy area with lots of little winding streets and virtually impassible for cars. It’s also one of the centers for “Fado,” traditional Portuguese music - sort of a Portuguese version of the blues.  I went to a restaurant called Estaca Zero where there was a rotating cast of musicians from about 8 pm to midnight. The food was pretty good, but more importantly the vibe was welcoming and the music was excellent. The group seemed to know each other well, and it definitely seemed like people more or less walked in off the street to perform. I stayed about two and a half hours before walking back to the AirBNB, after a slight detour up into the upper parts of Alfama to get a view out over the water. Lisbon seems remarkably safe — people (of both genders) were wandering around well past midnight. I also really like the streets and sidewalks: they are almost exclusively a mix of sizes of cobblestones - very little pavement or asphalt. And the red of the roofs is gorgeous. Must be great for their urban heat index…


## Friday May 4
I was grateful for my hosts’ noon checkout time requirement, which let me fit a quick run in the Alfama hills. There are a few (actually probably many) sites of note in Alfama, but one of the big draws is that there are some very good lookouts over the city. So my run in the hills turned into a hill workout (with substantial walking). I went up to the Palace of Sea Jorge (but did not go in), the National Pantheon of Santa Engracia (which has a stunning vista, and which I also did not go in) and the Miradouro da Senhora do Monte (also a stunning view).

After the run, I came back to my AirBnb where I might Jefe (short for Jefferson), a Brazilian expat who worked for the owner of the AirBNB I stayed him. Jefe was super friendly, and willing to let me leave my bag at the AirBNB for the day while explored. So I did, and explored without bag!

I didn’t wander far at first: went to Pois Cafe, an eclectically decorated restaurant/coffeeshop. I had a great yogurt-oats-fruit breakfast and cappucino, and worked there for a couple hours. Then I walked through the Baixa district (many tourists, many shops) up to Barrio Alto and Chialdo (slightly less touristy, fairly hip). I basically ate my way through town; had an amazing chocolate gelato at Nannerella, then to Copenhagen Coffee Lab for another cafe and a pastry. Around 6 I started to make my way back to Alfama to pick my bag up and to head towards my new home for the next week and a half or so. I got on a bus towards Campo D’Ourique (where I’m staying with Sam and Emma), but wasn’t paying enough attention and soon ended up back in Alfama. So I got on another bus, paid better attention this time, and transferred. Then I ended up on the non-touristy part of the touristy trolley route which was … sorta fun. Not the most confidence inspiring vehicles, though. Finally, I met Sam at our place - he had just returned from Colombia, but was game to get dinner with me at the Ourique Market, which is a fun indoor market with food stalls (during the day) and restaurants serving food (during the night). There was also a children’s choir there. We got home about 10 and Sam immediately went to bed. I waited for Emma and her friend Hilary to get in late (they were on the Azores islands for a few days) before also heading to sleep… in my bunk bed!

## Saturday May 5
Slept in after waking up early, went shopping with Emma
Also went to get keys copied, and found a grinder for coffee (a bit pricy, but who knows... maybe I'll take it home)
Found a gym about 1km away, although it's not clear if we can become members because payment is difficult... they don't take cash or foreign credit cards
Came back home and went to sleep, still pooping brains out a bit. Did find a neat market nearby on the walk home.
Went out to watch two local soccer teams at a local bar, but left early again because of stomach.

# Sunday, May 6
* Delicious French brunch at La Boulangerie in Lapa district
* Took the train out to Melem
* Saw — but did not actually enter — all of the main Melem sights.
	* Padrão dos Descobrimentos: remarkable, leans out over water and celebrates the Portuguese age of discovery
	* Tower of Belem: At the mouth of the Tagus river, built to defend against pirates
	* Jerónimos Monastery: It is large, has the planetarium and the maritime museum inside. Both looked interesting, but… the crowds!
* Instead, I picked up a few pastries at Pasties de Belem (withstanding a small line to do so) and heading for the botanical garden. I almost overshot it, but turned around on seeing a malp. Totally worth it.
* Bussed and walked back to casa, met up with Emma and headed to the Parc de Estralla about 1km away, where we worked at a cafe table and then later behind a cafe table.
* Came back to the casa after getting dinner (and gelato!), made curry, watched a bit of warriors, worked briefly, and called it a night.

## Monday, May 7
* Just a regular work day… in Lisbon!
* Emma trying the “write for 30 mins” strategy w/me now. It’s a good one.
* Took off for a long lunch in the park near the place. I do like this park.
* Track with Kanner (200 x 4 x 2, with 2 min rest) actually felt OK. Nice track. Nice security guard, though he thought we were supposed to pay (but nobody asked us to).
* Evening time  brought us back home to make curry and to hang out before calling it a night.


## Tuesday, May 8
* Another work day! Struggling with cumulative and monthly stuff in JMP. This thing is an albatross! Conclusion: put it in final section and let people interpret what they want.
* Worked from home in the morning, then wrote some postcards and walk to the PO to mail them. Then continued on the Copenhagen Coffee Lab.
* Second visit to CCL - very bougie-American cafe. Delicious looking pastries and breads, much more attractive than the cold pizza slice I had. Nice cortado. Most people speak english, though, which is a bit odd.
* Jogged back home for a call with Josh Apte, documented elsewhere. Interesting call for sure.
* Came back to try to do CrossFit with Kanner, but they were full. Instead we did a fantastic run up to an abandoned restaurant in a park with an insane view of the city - Parc Panoramique de Monsanto. Great running trails, too, and almost nobody there! Wild.
* Came back to the casa and hung out, had dinner (chicken! rice! salad!) before working more.

## Wednesday, May 9
* Mostly a work day… productive in the morning but hit a wall. Did go for a quick run before dinner, which was Tapas with some very friendly waiters down in Lapa. Food was pretty good - esp. the octopus. Should not have had an espresso before bed - restless all night.
* Josh Neff just arrived for a few days, he’s now sharing top bunk. Not sure it’s such a great deal for me… he moves around a lot in his sleep, which felt like it was keeping me up, but could be the caffeine.

## Thursday, May 10
* Woke up early to take the train to Sintra and avoid the crowds. It sort of worked, I guess. Started out with a long walk up the very beautiful Vila Saletti, followed by a tour of the Palace de Pena. Palace is wild - mixes many different styles, actually relatively recent for castles in Western Europe (18th centre).
* Stop \#2 was the Castle of the Moors, which was from a considerably easier period (11th centre) and much less well preserved, as you might expect. Slightly lower than Pena but I think it had better views. Went back down through the forest to check out the Quinta de Regalaria, which was the coolest so far, mainly because it has a network of hidden tunnels on the grounds. Really unique.
* Had a piriquita (after the counter-lady screwed with me for a couple minutes before revealing that she spoke perfect english). It was a tasty pastry.
* Came back home and napped. Trying to work.

## Friday, May 11
* Slept in until 8:30, it was delightful. Wrote for 30 minutes and prepared a todo list for the day before heading out.
* Emma and I (and soon after, Josh), went to LXFactory, a hip area of shops, cafes, restaurants, and bars mostly frequented by young people. We worked from there for the morning - super pleasant. Then we walked back to the house and worked a bit more before I left to meet up with Sam to run.
* Unexpected bonus today: Jenna Fullerton got in touch due to a family e-mail chain, since she and her boyfriend Jeremy were visiting Lisbon. They met us at this delicious Mexican place for dinner (Pistola y Corazon), which was also in a hip and crowded area… but the food was on point. Maybe the best I’ve had all trip. Jenna and Jeremy just arrived from 3 days in Madrid, where they saw a Flamenco show and a bullfight. Here they’ve walked around the Alfama and went to Sintra, and tonight they’ll go to a Fado show and then go to a club that doesn’t even start “going” until 2:30am. They invited us out, but… we’re here at home now. We old.

## Saturday, May 12
* Ate a delicious Sam-cooked breakfast before heading out on a Sam-planned adventure
* We rented a car (relatively cheap!) and drove south across the bridge to [Praia de Baleeira](https://goo.gl/maps/tL58RW24Dqy), a remote, rocky beach with a windy and not entirely straightforward descent. Day was gorgeous. Once we got down to the bottom there were a bunch of scuba divers. There were some remnants of old buildings that we couldn’t figure out the purpose of.
* Next stop was another, even more scenic (but somewhat more crowded sandy beach called [Rebiera Do Cavalo Beach](https://goo.gl/maps/MreRmyQEJPR2) where we picnicked, lay on the sand, and briefly hopped in the water.
* Also made another stop in the nearby resort town, where we went a largely unremarkable walk, except for the excellent long jumping platform we discovered.
* On the way back to town we went to [Ponto Finale](https://goo.gl/maps/W1tVWE1pdEr), a restaurant with a gorgeous view of the city, where we had a couple of soups while sitting next to the water. A long discussion of quantitative and qualitative research and economics’ place in social science ensued.

## Sunday, May 13
* Slept in, then headed out northwest past Sintra (it was Emma’s day to plan). After, of course, a quick stop by McDonald’s for a McFlurrie (it was Emma’s day to plan)
* Then we went on the best trail run / walk / hike ever. We started out near [Cabo de Roca](https://goo.gl/maps/ahouQE5QMiA2), the westernmost point in Europe (but did not to the town, which seemed to already be overrun with tourists) and headed North up the coast to [Praia de Ursa](https://goo.gl/maps/gipZ8q8CKMw), a gorgeous (and seemingly semi-nude) beach that reminded me of Muir Beach in Marin. In fact, many parts of this day reminded me of the Northern California coastline - Marin or Santa Cruz (Wilder Ranch in particular). We made our further north through a small variety of terrain and with no end of heart-thumping views, including one very, very large drop-off in to the ocean - the only time I’ve ever seen caution railings in Portugal. We also unexpectedly happened across some dinosaur tracks that had been laid and then upturned by seismic activity. After about four hours of meanderings inland we made our way back to the car.
* From there we headed further north, looking for food. We were planning to find a restaurant on the coast, but instead happened across a little farmers market where we had one of our best meals yet - an italian place on the side of the road staffed by, well, hippies. Hippies who make damn good pizza, and salad. After another hour basking in the sun with some vinos and our food, we continued further north to a bar on [Praia de Adraga](https://goo.gl/maps/NWynQo4Q4tG2), which we had overlooked earlier on the hike. And then home and to bed.

## Monday, May 12
* I woke up early to prep for my talk at Nova, arriving around 10:30 to meet Antonieta C. de Sa. We had a nice chat over coffee before heading up for an hourlong seminar with the (larger than expected) environment/resources group they have at the school. The group was engaged and lively, which was fun. We had lunch afterwards in the university cafe, where I heard about their new building, some wild trips by Vladimar (who is Russian) to Vladistok and by another woman whose name I forget (she did Urban) to India. Lesson from the latter is to not drive across India.
* Afterwards, I went on a shopping spree, in search or cork, Portuguese wool scarves, pottery, and azulejos. I succeeded in finding those things, and after a brief work session in the park to prepare for these defense tonight (and an even briefer call with one of my undergraduate research assistants, who probably didn’t imagine that I was sitting in a park up near the top of the Alfama), met up with Sam and Emma at an “underground” Chinese restaurant near the [Martim Moniz](https://goo.gl/maps/DRuNfx1d95t) station, which is a bit downscale (and preferable) to its neighbour Baixa.  The restaurant was underground in the sense that it was basically in an apartment, with no visible markings outside to indicate it - you just had to know. It may have actually been bootleg at one point, but these days it’s apparently just part of the experience. I assume they’re all normally regulated, since it wasn’t particularly challenging to find out about, per Kanner.

## Tuesday, May 13
* My last day in Portugal! I decided to go to Evora. The train was fantastic, although the brosefs chatting it up next to me the whole time were not fantastic. But I moved.
* Ran across a beautiful garden before heading into the city centre. After an hour spent trying to get change for a 100 (with eventually success at the bank), I was finally able to explore the town. There is definitely a slightly less pronounced grasp of English here relative to Lisbon.
* The Roman ruins and the cathedral with the astonishing panorama of the city were my favourite parts of the experience. But after a few hours, well, I think I’ve seen most of Ever. Think I’ll head to the library for a little while. Remainder of touristing will be to walk along the walls and then check out the cathedral of bones.
